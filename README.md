# Restaurant-website
This is a restaurant website using majorly html and css and slight js. Basically it contains the navbar, home section, menu, about, services and contact section. The star of the show is the menu   icon that when toggled shows  several types of courses and a soup category in the starter course that is selected based on day by a Js code.
